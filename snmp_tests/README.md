Simple tests for two well-known Python SNMP implementations: Net-SNMP and pysnmp
(`pysnmp.entity.rfc3413.oneliner`). After testing, it has been decided to use
Net-SNMP (`../ubntsig.py` module is a simple wrapper for it). I don't exactly 
remember why such selection has been made, but it most likely for performance
reason.
